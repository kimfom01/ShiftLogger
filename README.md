# Shift Logger


## Requirements
- [x] This is an application where you should record a worker's shifts.
- [x] You need to create two applications: the Web API and the UI that will call it.
- [x] All validation and user input should happen in the UI app.
- [x] Your API's controller should be lean. Any logic should be handled in a separate "service".
- [x] You should use SQL Server, not SQLite
- [x] You should use the "code first" approach to create your database, using Entity Framework's migrations tool.

## What I learnt
- [x] Writing an API
- [x] Testing API using Swagger
- [x] Testing an API using Postman
